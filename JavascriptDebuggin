A debugging tool is essential for JavaScript development. Mozilla Firefox provides a debugger via the Firebug extension (available to download from Firebug); Safari and Chrome provide built-in consoles.

Each console offers:

    single- and multi-line editors for experimenting with JavaScript

    an inspector for looking at the generated source of your page

    a Network or Resources view, to examine network requests

When you are writing JavaScript code, you can use the following methods to send messages to the console:

    console.log() for sending general log messages

    console.dir() for logging a browseable object

    console.warn() for logging warnings

    console.error() for logging error messages

Other console methods are also available, though they may differ from one browser to another. The consoles also provide the ability to set break points and watch expressions in your code for debugging purposes.
